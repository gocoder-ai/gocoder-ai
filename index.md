## Whoami

I'm a high school student who started programming by learning C++, which helped me learn essential fundamentals in computer science. After that, I began to code in Go and build various desktop applications. I explored different programming languages such as Python, Rust, and Haskell. I love coding and learning new things and open to collaborating and sharing insights with each others. I love solving coding challenges like Project Euler. I also like playing Minecraft. I enjoy working with technologies like Fyne and Arduino.
